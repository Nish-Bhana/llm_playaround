    "- Typically there are 3 ways people can interact with LLMs.\n",
    "    - Making your own from scratch (collecting data, deinfing architecture, training model,...)\n",
    "    - Making use of those made by others (either people or organisations)\n",
    "    - Hybrid of the two (e.g \"building ontop\" of a new model)\n",
    "- We will primarily focus on working with ready made LLMs **_however_** will touch more granular code in certain places to help explain how the components work under the hood.\n",
    "    - We will draw heavy inspiration from the code provided in this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/Easy-Transformer/blob/clean-transformer-demo/Clean_Transformer_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=EDlMEk0LVcdy) for implementing the granular code.\n",
    "    - Ultimately you can also start from pre-existing models and then make your own ontop of those.\n",
    "- Good questions raised during the my last talk:\n",
    "    - What do you do if you want to build models in not so common languages?"

    "- What is attention? In particular the mechanism \n",
    "    - Remember the attention mechanism is all about learning efficient representations for your text.\n",
    "        - To do so it leverages the idea of *dot products* to create a similarity measure between your tokens $q \\times k^{T}$\n",
    "        - You can then generatate an *attention pattern/score* for each token (destination pos / query) which acts as a probability distribution over prior source tokens (keys).\n",
    "        - The values of the distribution then act as weights to decide on how much information to copy over \n",
    "        $\\text{softmax}(\\frac{q k^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})$\n",
    "    - A another way of thinking about it is that attention is essentially *moving information between token positions* e.g from source positions (keys) to destination positions (queries)\n",
    "        - This moving in done in such a way to maximize the relevant information that is contained at each token position as per the relation between that token and all others that are *causally prior* to it in the case of GPT based models.\n",
    "    - This is the only part of the transformer which moves information between positions.\n",
    "- Why do you have multi-attention heads?\n",
    "    - Each head is meant to independently learn representations of your text (each has it's own set of parameters i.e weight matricies)\n",
    "    - You can then efficiently combine the knowledge learned by those heads to in theory gain a better understanding\n",
    "        - As the saying goes \"two-eyes are better than one\"\n",
    "    - Some cool maths can show that concatenating the heads outputs together is equivalent of linearly adding each output to the residual stream\n",
    "    - You generally find that the output dimension of the heads are smaller than the residual stream width e.g $\\frac{d_{model}}{d_{head}} = n_{heads}$"
