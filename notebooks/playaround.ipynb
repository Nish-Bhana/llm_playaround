    "- Typically there are 3 ways people can interact with LLMs.\n",
    "    - Making your own from scratch (collecting data, deinfing architecture, training model,...)\n",
    "    - Making use of those made by others (either people or organisations)\n",
    "    - Hybrid of the two (e.g \"building ontop\" of a new model)\n",
    "- We will primarily focus on working with ready made LLMs **_however_** will touch more granular code in certain places to help explain how the components work under the hood.\n",
    "    - We will draw heavy inspiration from the code provided in this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/Easy-Transformer/blob/clean-transformer-demo/Clean_Transformer_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=EDlMEk0LVcdy) for implementing the granular code.\n",
    "    - Ultimately you can also start from pre-existing models and then make your own ontop of those.\n",

    "#### Einops\n",
    "\n",
    "[Einops](https://einops.rocks/) is a great python library for performing tensor operations in a reliable way. It has good integration with a bunch of other deep learning frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Einops is great as it makes tensor manipulation much easier which typically can be error prone (at least for me...) for me this is largely due to it's interface.\n",
    "- Foundations come from einstein's summation notation (those you studied physics might have come across it before).\n",
    "- Here is a [great post](https://rockt.github.io/2018/04/30/einsum) which goes over the background theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's dataclasses module, introduced in Python 3.7, is a powerful tool for creating classes that primarily store data. Here's a summary of when to use it and how to apply it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When to Consider Using dataclasses\n",
    "    - **Simplifying Class Definitions**: Use dataclasses when you need classes that mainly store data and you want to reduce boilerplate code. They're ideal for classes where you would traditionally write numerous __init__, __repr__, __eq__, and other dunder methods manually.\n",
    "    - **Immutable Data Structures**: If you need immutable data structures (similar to tuples), dataclasses with frozen parameters can be a good choice.\n",
    "    - **Comparing Object Instances**: They are useful when you need to compare instances based on their content rather than their identity in memory.\n",
    "    - **Lightweight Data Storage**: Ideal for classes that will be used to store data and not much else, especially when you need a clear and concise representation of the data structure.\n",
    "- How do use:\n",
    "    - **Decorate your class:** Use `@dataclass` around your class, can define data as class attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    field1: int\n",
    "    field2: str\n",
    "    field3: float = 0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pytorch Primer\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes we can think of PyTorch as acting as the main library/framework which contains all the necessary tools for us to work with Deep Learning techniques (in particular building our model).\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch itself has so much information that it would be a standalone course in and of itself to get familiar with it. I highly suggest checking out the following [PyTorch Video course](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?si=0eKJOeg86RGTCwMq) to get a solid foundational understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes I have added a few points below which showcases what things are.\n",
    "\n",
    "| PyTorch functionality | What does it do?|\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "|torch.nn\t| Contains all of the building blocks for computational graphs (essentially a series of computations executed in a particular way).|\n",
    "|torch.nn.Parameter\t| Stores tensors that can be used with nn.Module. If requires_grad=True gradients (used for updating model parameters via gradient descent) are calculated automatically, this is often referred to as \"autograd\".|\n",
    "|torch.nn.Module | The base class for all neural network modules, all the building blocks for neural networks are subclasses. If you're building a neural network in PyTorch, your models should subclass nn.Module. Requires a forward() method be implemented.|\n",
    "|torch.optim\t| Contains various optimization algorithms (these tell the model parameters stored in nn.Parameter how to best change to improve gradient descent and in turn reduce the loss).|\n",
    "| def forward()\t| All nn.Module subclasses require a forward() method, this defines the computation that will take place on the data passed to the particular nn.Module (e.g. the linear regression formula above).|"

    "- What is attention? In particular the mechanism \n",
    "    - Remember the attention mechanism is all about learning efficient representations for your text.\n",
    "        - To do so it leverages the idea of *dot products* to create a similarity measure between your tokens $q \\times k^{T}$\n",
    "        - You can then generatate an *attention pattern/score* for each token (destination pos / query) which acts as a probability distribution over prior source tokens (keys).\n",
    "        - The values of the distribution then act as weights to decide on how much information to copy over \n",
    "        $\\text{softmax}(\\frac{q k^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})$\n",
    "    - A another way of thinking about it is that attention is essentially *moving information between token positions* e.g from source positions (keys) to destination positions (queries)\n",
    "        - This moving in done in such a way to maximize the relevant information that is contained at each token position as per the relation between that token and all others that are *causally prior* to it in the case of GPT based models.\n",
    "    - This is the only part of the transformer which moves information between positions.\n",
    "- Why do you have multi-attention heads?\n",
    "    - Each head is meant to independently learn representations of your text (each has it's own set of parameters i.e weight matricies)\n",
    "    - You can then efficiently combine the knowledge learned by those heads to in theory gain a better understanding\n",
    "        - As the saying goes \"two-eyes are better than one\"\n",
    "    - Some cool maths can show that concatenating the heads outputs together is equivalent of linearly adding each output to the residual stream\n",
    "    - You generally find that the output dimension of the heads are smaller than the residual stream width e.g $\\frac{d_{model}}{d_{head}} = n_{heads}$"
