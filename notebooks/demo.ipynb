    "### Aims\n",
    "- To aid you in understanding how transformers work under the hood by peering into the components of a GPT-2 style transformer and building it from the ground up.\n",
    "    - Showcase libraries and tools along the way.\n",
    "- To demonstrate how you can leverage open source implementations rather than building them from scratch.\n",
    "    - Touch on a GPT-2 style use for text generation for the sake of similiarity but many others exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- No real hard prerequisites (can learn alot of it on the go!)\n",
    "- Having said that a few things would be *\"nice to have\"* to help absorb things faster\n",
    "    - Ideally some experience with programming (ideally Python)\n",
    "    - Some basic groundings in Math (Linear Algebra)\n",
    "    - Passion! Things evolve quickly and come with challenges, have to have determination to persevere.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typically there are 3 ways people can interact with LLMs.\n",
    "    - Making your own from scratch (collecting data, deinfing architecture, training model,...)\n",
    "    - Making use of those made by others (either people or organisations)\n",
    "    - Hybrid of the two (e.g \"building ontop\" of a new model)\n",
    "- During our walkthrough we will explore the components (from scratch) and then end with making use of existing models"

    "\n",
    "##### Einops\n",
    "\n",
    "[Einops](https://einops.rocks/) is a great python library for performing tensor operations in a reliable way. It has good integration with a bunch of other deep learning frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Einops is great as it makes tensor manipulation much easier which typically can be error prone (at least for me...) for me this is largely due to it's interface.\n",
    "- Foundations come from einstein's summation notation (those you studied physics might have come across it before).\n",
    "- Here is a [great post](https://rockt.github.io/2018/04/30/einsum) which goes over the background theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to this we make use of [fancy-einsum](https://pypi.org/project/fancy-einsum/) which provides slightly more convienient version of `torch.einsum` for our einstein summation calculation processes.\n",

    "##### Dataclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's dataclasses module, introduced in Python 3.7, is a powerful tool for creating classes that primarily store data. Here's a summary of when to use it and how to apply it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When to Consider Using dataclasses\n",
    "    - **Simplifying Class Definitions**: Use dataclasses when you need classes that mainly store data and you want to reduce boilerplate code. They're ideal for classes where you would traditionally write numerous __init__, __repr__, __eq__, and other dunder methods manually.\n",
    "    - **Immutable Data Structures**: If you need immutable data structures (similar to tuples), dataclasses with frozen parameters can be a good choice.\n",
    "    - **Comparing Object Instances**: They are useful when you need to compare instances based on their content rather than their identity in memory.\n",
    "    - **Lightweight Data Storage**: Ideal for classes that will be used to store data and not much else, especially when you need a clear and concise representation of the data structure.\n",
    "- How do use:\n",
    "    - **Decorate your class:** Use `@dataclass` around your class, can define data as class attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    field1: int\n",
    "    field2: str\n",
    "    field3: float = 0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pytorch Primer\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes we can think of PyTorch as acting as the main library/framework which contains all the necessary tools for us to work with Deep Learning techniques (in particular building our model).\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch itself has so much information that it would be a standalone course in and of itself to get familiar with it. I highly suggest checking out the following [PyTorch Video course](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?si=0eKJOeg86RGTCwMq) to get a solid foundational understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes I have added a few points below which showcases what things are.\n",
    "\n",
    "| PyTorch functionality | What does it do?|\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "|torch.nn\t| Contains all of the building blocks for computational graphs (essentially a series of computations executed in a particular way).|\n",
    "|torch.nn.Parameter\t| Stores tensors that can be used with nn.Module. If requires_grad=True gradients (used for updating model parameters via gradient descent) are calculated automatically, this is often referred to as \"autograd\".|\n",
    "|torch.nn.Module | The base class for all neural network modules, all the building blocks for neural networks are subclasses. If you're building a neural network in PyTorch, your models should subclass nn.Module. Requires a forward() method be implemented.|\n",
    "|torch.optim\t| Contains various optimization algorithms (these tell the model parameters stored in nn.Parameter how to best change to improve gradient descent and in turn reduce the loss).|\n",
    "| def forward()\t| All nn.Module subclasses require a forward() method, this defines the computation that will take place on the data passed to the particular nn.Module (e.g. the linear regression formula above).|\n",

    "\n",
    "- We have text data we want to feed into the model **_however_** the model doesn't like text but numbers. \n",
    "    - We therefore must convert our text to numbers via a process known as tokenization.\n",
    "- Many different types of tokenization exist and have various trade offs (Character based, word based, sub-word based)\n",
    "    - Short post touching on this [here](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-tokenization).\n",
    "    - **Character based**\n",
    "        - Split your text up into individual characters.\n",
    "        - Upsides in that you can handle mispelled words or rare words (impossible to not recognise something)\n",
    "        - Downsides are that you lose alot of semantic meaning behind your text since considering all text as just a stream of characters.\n",
    "            - This is bad since the objective behind *\"language modelling\"* is to extract meaning from your text.\n",
    "            - Would require vast resources (compute, memory, data etc) for this to even be viable.\n",
    "        - Rarely used in practice because of the downside.\n",
    "    - **Word based**\n",
    "        - Split your text into words.\n",
    "        - Upsides in that you don't need to force the model to try and learn words from characters\n",
    "            - Training process is slightly less complex\n",
    "        - Downsides:\n",
    "            - Punctuation and other rules may need to be added otherwise your punctuation would get merged with your words influencing learning.\n",
    "            - Things like word misspellings, conjugations, declinations and other grammatical things can cause a large vocab size\n",
    "            - Large vocab would then mean large compression task by the network having inefficiencies.\n",
    "                - Imagine a vocab of the order $10^5$ and model vectors of the order $10^3$ thats $10^8$ weights! Some models are that size alone\n",
    "            - Restricting vocab size can help overcome this however can cause information loss\n",
    "    - **Sub-word based**\n",
    "        - Splits your text into smaller \"subwords\" (slightly strange)\n",
    "        - Upside is that it balances the up and downsides of the prior techniques\n",
    "        - Various algorithms exist for this which similiar word based processes combine statistical and rule based algorithms. \n",
    "- Will demo below the general jist of tokenization below using a janky version of character based tokenization\n",

    "- What is attention? In particular the mechanism \n",
    "    - Remember the attention mechanism is all about learning efficient representations for your text.\n",
    "        - To do so it leverages the idea of *dot products* to create a similarity measure between your tokens $q \\times k^{T}$\n",
    "        - You can then generatate an *attention pattern/score* for each token (destination pos / query) which acts as a probability distribution over prior source tokens (keys).\n",
    "        - The values of the distribution then act as weights to decide on how much information to copy over \n",
    "        $\\text{softmax}(\\frac{q k^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})$\n",
    "    - A another way of thinking about it is that attention is essentially *moving information between token positions* e.g from source positions (keys) to destination positions (queries)\n",
    "        - This moving in done in such a way to maximize the relevant information that is contained at each token position as per the relation between that token and all others that are *causally prior* to it in the case of GPT based models.\n",
    "    - This is the only part of the transformer which moves information between positions.\n",
    "- Why do you have multi-attention heads?\n",
    "    - Each head is meant to independently learn representations of your text (each has it's own set of parameters i.e weight matricies)\n",
    "    - You can then efficiently combine the knowledge learned by those heads to in theory gain a better understanding\n",
    "        - As the saying goes \"two-eyes are better than one\"\n",
    "    - Some cool maths can show that concatenating the heads outputs together is equivalent of linearly adding each output to the residual stream\n",
    "    - You generally find that the output dimension of the heads are smaller than the residual stream width e.g $\\frac{d_{model}}{d_{head}} = n_{heads}$\n",
    "- The way the outputs of each head are combined can be thought about differently\n",
    "    - Stacking the outputs of each head together and then performing a final linear map to get you back to the residual stream size is the same as multiplying each head by it's own weight matrix and then summing all the heads outputs together.\n",
    "    - Concatenation definition is often preferred since it produces a larger and more compute efficient matrix multiply but theoretically, they are equivalent and often preferred in a theoretical context to think of the heads as independently additive.\n",
    "- Thinking of it like this the operations can be formatted compactly into a single equation which yields the output of a single head: $𝐴 𝑥 𝑊_{𝑉}^{𝑇} 𝑊_{𝑂}^{𝑇}$\n",
    "    - $𝐴$ is the attention matrix dimension ($𝑃_{𝑑}×𝑃_{𝑠}$)\n",
    "        - Breaking down further as $qk^T$ where $q$ is our query vector and $k$ our key vector.\n",
    "        - Expanding this we get $q = xW_{Q}^{T}$ and $k = xW_{K}^{T}$ so neatly this becomes $A = xW_{Q}^{T} W_{K} x^{T}$\n",
    "    - $𝑥$ is the input matrix read from the residual stream consisting of your tokens and respective embedding ($𝑃_{𝑆}×𝑑_{𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙}$)\n",
    "    - $𝑊_{𝑉}^{𝑇}$ is the transpose of your value weight matrix ($𝑑_{𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙}×𝑑_{ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑}$)\n",
